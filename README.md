# Capstone Project - Emotion Recognition with Face Logging

## üìå Overview
This project is a part of our multimodal AI assistant system.  
It uses **DeepFace**, **OpenCV**, and **MySQL** to:

- Recognize faces from a webcam feed  
- Detect emotions in real time  
- Store results (face embeddings + emotions) in a MySQL database  
- Log unknown users automatically  

Built with **Python 3.12**, managed in a **virtual environment**, and designed to integrate with a larger **Streamlit-based AI system**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imAditya06/capstone.git
cd capstone

# Create venv
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash

# Activate venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ¢Ô∏è MySQL Setup
### 1.Open MySQL Workbench (or CLI).
### 2.Run the following SQL script (also provided in mysql_setup.sql):
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS emotion_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Create a dedicated user
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'emotion_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourStrongPassword';

-- Grant privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON emotion_db.* TO 'emotion_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
### 3.Ensure the tables are created: users, embeddings, emotions, logs.

## üîë Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with:
```bash
DB_USER=emotion_user
DB_PASS=YourStrongPassword
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=emotion_db
POOL_NAME=emotion_pool
POOL_SIZE=5
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project
### 1. Build Face Embeddings
Place known user images inside the known_people/ folder (each person in their own subfolder). Then run:
```bash
python build_embeddings.py
```
### 2. Start the Webcam App
```bash
python camera_app.py
```
The webcam will open.
Recognized faces and emotions will be displayed on screen.
All results will be stored in MySQL.

## üìä Viewing Results in MySQL
Inside MySQL, run:
```sql
USE emotion_db;
SELECT * FROM logs;
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM emotions;
```
